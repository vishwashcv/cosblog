        Front End Web Development Skills: How to Become a Front End Developer
      </h2>
      <br />
      Front-end developers are among the highest-paid specialists in the world.
      They employ their skills and knowledge to create aesthetically pleasing
      and streamlined websites.

      <br />
      <br />
      To work, front-end developers are not required to have a formal education
      or certification. Instead, students must comprehend the foundations of
      programming languages, front-end development frameworks, and front-end
      development.
      <br />
      <br />
      By first comprehending what front end programming comprises, the technical
      and soft skills needed, the languages and frameworks accessible, and some
      starting steps, you will learn how to become a front end developer by
      reading this tutorial.
      <br />
      <br />
      According to Glassdoor, the average yearly salary for a front end
      developer in the US is $86,178. A "typical" front-end developer can make
      $71,350 per year, according to Payscale.

      <br />
      <br />

      We'll start with defining terms like "front end," "back end," and "full
      stack" since if you're unfamiliar with the computer world, you may not
      know what they Simply.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>What is front end?</h2>
      <br />
      <br />
      Front-end developers make all the websites we visit, the e-commerce sites
      we shop at, the blogs we read, and so forth, user-friendly and
      aesthetically beautiful.
      <br />
      <br />
      The front end and the back end are the two main facets of web development
      to take into account while creating websites and web apps.
      <br />
      <br />
      As the name suggests, front-end development is concerned with the user
      interface of any web application. The user interacts with this by doing
      things like clicking buttons, scrolling across pages, filling out forms,
      and so forth. This is a web application's client-side functionality.
      <br />
      <br />
      The term "back end" describes activities that take place in the
      background, including infrastructure, database connection and
      communication, and other activities. A front end and a rear end combined
      is referred to as a full stack.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>What Does a Front-end Developer Do?</h2>
      <br />
      <br />
      We just covered the front end, back end, and whole stack parts of web
      programming. Also, according to the areas of web development in which they
      are skilled, there are many sorts of developers. Hence, there are
      full-stack developers, back-end developers, and front-end developers.

      <br />
      <br />
      The person in charge of designing the user interface and user experience
      (UI/UX) that users utilise to access the programme in question is known as
      a front-end developer. They are problem solvers who employ coding
      languages, tools, imagination, and expertise to produce a website or
      application that addresses a user's need and is aesthetically pleasing.
      <br />
      <br />
      A back-end developer is in charge of all backend-related tasks, such as
      logic, database communication, and much more, as was already mentioned.

      <br />
      <br />
      Ultimately, full-stack engineers are able to start and complete a project
      independently because they are knowledgeable in both front-end and
      back-end development.
      <br />
      <br />
      The person or people that design the interface and the user experience
      (UI/UX) typically work in a formal context or in a typical organisation.
      <br />
      <br />
      The front-end and back-end developers will then receive their design and
      work on implementation to make the designed app functional on the web. The
      application will be written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by the front-end
      developer to duplicate the design.
